        <p style="text-indent: 0;">Dear Customer Training Team,</p>
        <p>Thank you for taking the time to consider my application, and for choosing your path today in either video format or text, in this effort to learn a bit more about me. As a people manager and educator I strongly believe in meeting people where they are, and providing options accordingly, and so I thought this would be a fun exercise.</p>
        <p>My path at HubSpot has been long and full of zig zags, and yet, it has led to this very precise moment in time where I feel “born” to support the needs of your team. My strengths can really break down into three categories: 5 years of HubSpot institutional knowledge, best in class performance throughout that time, and a long standing passion for both content creation and education. I believe my history, intellectual interests, and award winning execution  in four different departments the past five years could make me a unique asset to your organization. I’m not sure anyone has actually experienced the full flywheel, like I have.</p>
        <p>I started here in 2015 as a Latam Sales Engineer on the Swat team, the first team to upsell and cross-sell our first ever add-on products at the time: Reporting, Ads, and the Websites tool. I quickly developed a passion for working with different customer needs, voices, and cultures in this role, whilst also developing a longstanding technical relationship with our platform that has aided me in every subsequent role since.  I worked very closely with product management as well as sales enablement, and played a major role in educating audiences throughout Latin America, as the first ever dedicated sales specialist in that region. From sales engineering I then went on to become a Senior Account Executive, and leveraged my technical understanding of our toolsets, particularly within our add-ons, to become the top performing rep at HubSpot in terms of install base sales that year, 2017.</p>
        <p>Then came 2018 and an offer to potentially play a major role in the construction of our Bogota/Latam office. Following the credo that “ anytime you have the chance to be the first at something at HubSpot you should do it,” I took on a hybrid role where I played Onboarding Specialist, Customer Success Manager, as well as Renewals Manager in one for the Brazilian Market. I ran classroom trainings, sometimes multiple times a day, and spent at least one week a quarter traveling from customer to customer all over the country. That year, I won the Heart award at that time called the Champagner, in particular for having worked cross-departmentally with localization, marketing, sales, and support. We had the highest retention numbers in the company globally, and I benefited from a range of programmatic experience in that effort.</p>
        <p>This track record of success led me to feel confident enough to then apply into a leadership role, which is where I currently am. As a Support Manager, I have been educating young HubSpotters and building a team of 18 representatives who had never before touched our technology, and can now regard themselves as world leading experts in their field. As a manager I am in charge of the “Growth Coaching” Pillar within the support organization, and have done a lot of work building out the competencies and behaviors that define success in that arena. I could see a lot of parallels there in terms of building up customer competencies and behaviors. I’ve also led the global support organization in terms of SQLs and think that accomplishment could translate nicely into finding opportunities within classroom settings.</p>
        <p>The biggest professional milestone of my life came when this specific team awarded me with the Great Manager Award. All I can say about that is that I am grateful, and that the feeling was mutual with every one of my people. Greatness comes from the team and not any one individual, and I place a lot of emphasis on the fact that if a team is doing well and enjoying the work, it’s because of that team as a whole. Teams create culture, and I’d look forward to taking part in the development of the Customer Training Team’s culture, which I’ve heard is very tight-knit - exactly what I’m hoping for. Accordingly, I feel very prepared to influence and impact our customer training program from all sides: revenue, content, and people management.</p>
